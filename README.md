# minimind: A Minimalist Machine Learning Library written in Swift

The only dependency now is [Surge](https://github.com/mattt/Surge) but it might be removed in the future. The main focus now is nonparametric models (Gaussian Processes) but more will be added soon. I aim to keep the interface as close to numpy/scikit-learn as possible. See playground files for examples.
